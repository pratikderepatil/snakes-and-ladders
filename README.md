# Snakes and Ladder game

There are one hundred squares full of traps and tricksâ€¦ Roll the dice and try your luck! Ladders will take you up but Snakes will take you down! This is a great game!

## Rules

- If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder (the ladder starts from green tile).
- If you land on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake (the snake starts from a red tile).
- Get to the space that says '100' is the winner (yellow tile).
